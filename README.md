# Portfolio Assignment
for this project I asked ChatGPT to write me an assignment where I can practice all I have learned so far: CSS, HTML and very beginner friendly JavaScript. In this README.md I will keep you up to date on things I'm struggling with and how I am finding solutions. I hope you enjoy it!

## ðŸŒ¿ Assignment Theme: *"Mini Personal Portfolio Website"*

Create a simple personal portfolio site that showcases **who you are**, **what you can do**, and a fun **interactive element** using JavaScript.

---

## ðŸ”— Your Website Should Contain at Least 3 Pages:

### 1. **Home Page (index.html)**

**Purpose:** Welcome the user and give a brief intro.

#### Must Include:

* A navigation bar linking to all 3 pages
* A welcome message
* A short introduction paragraph about you
* An image of your choice (can be a placeholder)
* A button that changes the background color using JavaScript when clicked

---

### 2. **Projects Page (projects.html)**

**Purpose:** Show 2â€“3 things youâ€™ve worked on or are proud of (real or fictional).

#### Must Include:

* A heading ("My Projects")
* Three project boxes/cards with:

  * A title
  * A short description
  * A placeholder image or emoji
* A hover effect using CSS (e.g., background color or scale effect)
* Bonus (Optional): Add a simple JavaScript filter button that shows/hides a project when clicked

---

### 3. **Contact Page (contact.html)**

**Purpose:** Let users get in touch with you.

#### Must Include:

* A form with the following fields:

  * Name
  * Email
  * Message
  * Submit button
* Use JavaScript to:

  * Show a popup or message when the form is submitted (e.g., "Thanks for your message!")
* Basic validation: Make sure fields aren't empty before submitting (use `if` statements)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements Summary

### âœ… HTML:

* At least 3 pages
* Semantic tags (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`)
* A navigation bar present on every page
* Use `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, etc.

### âœ… CSS:

* External stylesheet (not inline)
* Use at least:

  * A class and an ID selector
  * Flexbox or Grid (basic layout)
  * Hover effect on buttons or project cards
* Basic responsive design (nothing advancedâ€”just donâ€™t let it break)

### âœ… JavaScript:

* DOM manipulation:

  * Click button to change color or show a message
* Basic form validation
* Optional: a fun extra like filtering projects or showing/hiding content

---

## ðŸŒŸ Tips:

* Use a simple folder structure (`index.html`, `projects.html`, `contact.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`)
* Keep your code clean and commented
* Look up things when you get stuckâ€”this is part of learning!

Would you like me to generate a basic starter template or file structure to help you begin?
